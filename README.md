Tasks:
(For consideration, code changes in a fork are nice but not required)


1. What improvements would you make in the existing code and why?

2. Add a new fruit, Grapefruit 'G' with a standard price of 0.50 and a discount of 
   Apple, Orange, Banana, Grapefruit to 1.25.  This discount should be the first
   discount applied.
